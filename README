Comments:
*   I've set up a git repo for our code.
*   Done with skeleton code.
*   First draft complete. Solve should work. I think everything should work. Let's get ready to fix it.

Summary:
    We recursively call a method 'solve' to find all possible permutations of pushes and pops that will create a given output string from a given input string. This implementation expects to be told the number of input/output pairs it will test and then repeats its solving method for each pair.
